        <!-- In order to raise a custom screen reader notification, we need to supply 
            a XAML FrameworkElement's AutomationPeer. So create a TextBlock here as the
            source of that peer. (The containing Grid has no peer, so we can't use that.)
            We don't want any visuals to be impacted by the existence of this TextBlock,
            so set its dimensions to zero. We can't set its Visibility to Collapsed,
            because then we can't get an AutomationPeer from it. If somehow a screen
            reader does manage to navigate to this TextBlock, that won't have a significant 
            negative impact on the player experience, as it'll be a TextBlock which never  
            has any text set on it. -->
